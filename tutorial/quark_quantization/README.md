## Ryzen AI Model Quantization and Deployment

Welcome to the Ryzen AI Model Quantization tutorial. In this guide, you'll learn how to quantize your deep learning models for efficient deployment on NPU.

**AMD Quark** is a comprehensive cross-platform deep learning toolkit designed to simplify and enhance the quantization of deep learning models. Quark enables developers to optimize their models for deployment on a wide range of hardware backends, achieving significant performance gains without compromising accuracy.

Quark helps restore model accuracy that may be lost after quantization through various post training quantization techniques.

For more details refer to the [AMD Quark official documentation](https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/index.html)
